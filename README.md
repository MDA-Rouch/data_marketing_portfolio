# Data Marketing Portfolio

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ â€” this repo is where I share projects at the crossroads of **data science and marketing**.  
I work on turning messy campaign data into clear insights and tools that marketers can actually use.  

## Whatâ€™s inside? (Work in progress)

### 1. Campaign Scoring Engine 
How do you compare campaigns with different goals, spends, and sizes?  
This project uses Python + Power BI to create a scoring model that ranks campaigns fairly.  
- Normalization (so small/large campaigns can be compared)  
- Weighted scoring (manual and regression-based)  
- Power BI dashboard for quick decisions  

### 2. Attribution Dashboard
Attribution isnâ€™t just a buzzword â€” the model you choose changes your ROI story.  
Here I compare last-click, linear, and Shapley-value attribution in Python, with visual results in Tableau/Power BI.  

### 3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculator
Not all customers are equal.  
This demo uses CLV models (Pareto/NBD, BG/NBD) to predict expected revenue per customer, with a simple dashboard for marketers.  

## Tools I use
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, lifetimes, DoWhy  
- **SQL**: BigQuery / PostgreSQL  
- **Viz**: Power BI, Tableau Public  

## Why this repo?
- To **practice and share** real-world marketing analytics  
- To build tools I wish Iâ€™d had earlier in consulting gigs  
- To start conversations with other marketers, analysts, and data people
